# Mind Memo


*Introducing my Notes Application, a powerful tool built with React, Tailwind CSS, Material Tailwind, and CSS on the frontend. On the backend, I've utilized Node.js, Express, JWT authentication, and MongoDB for data storage.*

*This app offers a seamless user experience with features such as account creation, login, and secure authentication. Take control of your ideas by creating, editing, and deleting notes effortlessly. To add a personal touch, each user is assigned a dynamic avatar generated uniquely for them. Plus, you can customize your app's appearance with the light and dark mode options.*

*Boost your productivity and organization with this dynamic and versatile Notes Application..*
